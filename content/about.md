#### Welcome to my dev blog!

My name is Guillermo Estrada, I'm a fullstack software developer with a passion for writing amazing code. I've been wanting to write a developer blog for like 10 years and never got to it 😅. I have always love generative art and computer graphics, and in learning more about it, I found a renewed strength into writing this blog. I specialize in web services, distributed systems and have enjoyed coding in [Go](https://golang.org/) and [Javascript](https://nodejs.org/) for 10+ years 🥳. Although I have used more programming languages than I care to admit (C, Ruby, Python, Lua, D, PHP, etc...), I make a conscious effort to avoid Java 🙄. One of my short-term goals is to learn [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) as I like a lot what it has to offer, and I want to have fun with [nannou](https://nannou.cc/) and [web assembly](https://webassembly.org/).

The first purpose of this blog is to document my journey into becoming a generative artist! I'm really bad at drawing anything more than a stickman 😔, and I always wished I could do so masterfully, but I know my limitations. Thankfully I'm good at creating software, and that gives me an opportunity to accomplish my long lost dream 🤩. Generative art (and algorithmic art) is art, visual mostly, in which the design is generated by an algorithm. Now, that is something I can do 💪!

The other purpose is to share knowledge as a small way of giving back to the community ❤️. Develope blogs have saved me thousands of hours over the years in the endless pursuit of knowledge (and... you know, work). So a kudos to all developers around the world who find the time in their busy schedules to write and maintain a blog 👏, it is no easy feat, you have my respect and eternal appreciation. I will not be writing exclusively about generative art or computer graphics, but this is a dev blog after all, so you can expect the content to be consistent with that.

Last but not least, all work by the author (_Guillermo Estrada_) in this project is open source, it is available on [Github](https://github.com/phrozen/gestrada.dev) and is dual-licensed as follows:

All source code, is covered by the MIT License.  
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)  

This means that you can use all code snippets, source files, and the blog code itself in ANY way you like! And I'm not responsible for anything you break with it 😁. The MIT License is one of the most permissive open-source license you can find.

All content and material is covered by the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.  
[![License: CC BY-SA 4.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-CC%20BY--SA%204.0-green.svg)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)

This means that all non-code work: images, videos, audio, animation and the text of the posts themselves, is available for you to copy, redistribute, remix, transform, and build upon, in any medium and format, and for any purpose (even commercially), as long as you give me appropriate credit, and you distribute your contributions under the same license.

I kept it this way because CC licenses do not cover source code very well (or at all), and MIT License does not care about artwork. So dual-licensing gives us the best of both worlds. In short, use the content as you like, and I kindly ask for a link back to this blog is you find something awesome (or useful).

Finally, if you want to contribute, kindly do so in Github, I will be glad to collaborate with you! And if you like what you see, but can't contribute any other way, you can buy me a coffee ☕ to make sure I keep posting on time, I will be forever grateful. A coffee a day keeps the bugs 🐞 away! Make sure to tell me if you want your name in the list of contributors and a link to your site!
