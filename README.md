# gestrada.dev

This is the repository for my dev blog at [https://gestrada.dev](https://gestrada.dev)

In here you can find all source code and material used and produced in each post, as well as the post content itself, and any other related content in the site. This blog is proudly powered by:

- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) Static site generator: The world’s fastest framework for building websites
- [Coder](https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder) theme by [Luiz F. A. de Prá](https://github.com/luizdepra)
- Some goodies provided by the theme:
  - Comments by [utteranc.es](https://utteranc.es/)
  - Emoji support by [Twemoji](https://twemoji.twitter.com/)
  - Icons by [Fork Awesome](https://forkaweso.me/)
  - Privacy aware web analytics by [Goat Counter](https://www.goatcounter.com/)

And everything else is powered and hosted by [Github](https://github.com/)! This repository uses [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to run Hugo and deploy the build to [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), and thanks to [utteranc.es](https://utteranc.es/) comments are enabled using Github Issues!
